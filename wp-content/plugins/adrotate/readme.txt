== Description ==

With AdRotate you can easily place advertising banners pretty much anywhere on your site while managing almost everything from the easy to use dashboard. No fussing with your themes code if you don't want to.

Using AdRotate you can easily create your own adverts with basic HTML and/or Javascript code or use adverts from your favorite Ad Server such as Media.net, DFP, AdSense, Chitika, Doubleclick, JuiceAds and many more similar ad servers.

> With AdRotate you manage your advertising campaigns and banners with ease, right in your dashboard. 

In AdRotate it's easy to check up on how many impressions adverts have. Monitor ad groups and see which are most effective. Make the most of advertising with the many features AdRotate has to offer.

AdRotate looks and feels similar to the WordPress dashboard you already know, you're already familiar with AdRotate before you even start using the plugin. Familiarize yourself with the many useful features and you'll be up and running very quickly.
